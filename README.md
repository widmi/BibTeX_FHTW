Disclaimer: I modified/created the files "HarvardFHTWMR.bst" and "literatur.bib" as a tool for anyone who wants to use it. I can not issue any guarantee about the correctness of its output. However, I hope it's able to save you time and trouble with the quotations.
Originally created for UAS Technikum Wien, Mechatronics/Robotics, new standards may vary.
