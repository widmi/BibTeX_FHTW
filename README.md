# BibTeX_FHTW

Author: Michael Widrich

Description: This file contains a modified harvard style version, adapted to the UAS Technikum Wien Mechatronics/Robotics bibliography style standard in 2012. This bibliography style is based on the Anglia Rustky Harvard Style and owes much of its functionality to the agsm.bst and alpha.bst files. 

Directly available media types: bachelorsthesis/etc., book, chapter of edited book, datasheet/guide, dissertation/masterthesis, e-abstract (only abstract accessible), e-book, e-book (protected database accessed via university), edited book, journal, e-journal or e-magazine, e-journal or e-magazine (protected database accessed via university), newspaper, norm (ISO, etc.), online newspaper article, patent, picture/image/photograph, website.

Available languages: English, German, adaptable macros for further languages

Disclaimer: I modified/created the files "HarvardFHTWMR.bst" and "literatur.bib" as a tool for anyone who wants to use it. I can not issue any guarantee about the correctness of its output. However, I hope it's able to save you time and trouble with the quotations.
Originally created for UAS Technikum Wien, mechatronics/robotics, new standards may vary.

Please see the template pdfs for examples and a short manual.
